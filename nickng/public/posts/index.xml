      <description>Intro Recently, I saw the news about the launch of a scholarship programme by Google to help 5,000 more Singaporeans acquire &amp;ldquo;in-demand digital skills&amp;rdquo; and it gave me an idea to share about my journey as one of the graduates.
It has been exactly a year since I have joined Google‚Äôs Skills Ignition Cloud Technology program (Pathway 1). I have come a long way since then and managed to land myself a Cloud Engineer role in a bank.</description>

      <description>Hi! üëãüèª This is Nick and welcome to my site
I am so excited that I have finally gotten my site up and running. I have always wanted to start my own personal website to help me
  Clarify my thoughts
  Have an online presence
  Create more than I consume
  Yet, I have been putting it aside for about a year now because I find it hard to create just the website alone, and to start writing as I am never someone who is good in writing to begin with.</description>
