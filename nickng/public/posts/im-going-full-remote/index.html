The possibilities are endless. Yes, I really mean endless.\n  I get to work anywhere I want to. I can live in a city with a lower cost of living which will help me on my journey of financial independence\n  By living in another city, I get to travel and explore the country while I’m still “working”. I get to enjoy and have a mini holidays every other weekend, basically traveling becomes a part of my lifestyle.\n  I learn to live on my own. The experience I gain by living alone would be tremendous, it is essential in my journey of personal growth and self-awareness. I would be able to learn to be independent, be accountable for myself and most importantly understand myself better.\n  Living on my own in another city will drastically reduce the amount of time needed to gain these experiences alone. Rather than having to wait for the yearly overseas holiday trips, and earning “enough” money to get a rent here in Singapore so that I can live on my own, I can experience soaking myself in different cultures and also be independent just by one simple way of working - remotely. This is one way I can be efficient with my time.\n  Speaking of being efficient, I can plan my work around my most productive time of the day, rather than being fixated on the 9-5 working hours. I can “leave the office” once I get my work done and I do not have to wait till 5pm to that. I can utilise the other time to do other things that are important to me like writing, learning, and building my personal projects.\n  Cons:\nWith all the pros, there will always be cons. Let’s also explore some of that\n  Working hours may differ. I may have to work in the night, because of the different timezone that I am living. But that will not be a problem because I can always work somewhere in the similar timezone.\n  Security. Singapore is a rather safe country to live in, and I may not enjoy the same security that I am used to if I live in other countries. However, we only start to grow when we get out of our comfort zone. Also, if you are traveling to other countries for holidays, you are already exposing yourself to lesser security. So if I can have have the mindset of travelling for short holidays, I can definitely travel and work remotely. The risks are the same.\n  I will miss my family. Yes, that is going to be one of the drawbacks and something that will definitely happen. Especially if there is an emergency back at home and I have to be back ASAP. Again, this will not be a problem since I can work anywhere (though I will not want to be working in times of emergency) but you get the idea. I can always return home any time. Probably I have to think about working remotely in nearby countries so that I can return home quickly if there are any emergencies.\n  All in all, the benefits of working remotely outweigh the cons and the main thing I would get out of remote working is, I have control over my life in many ways.\nHow am I going to do that? The only way that can allow me to work remotely now would be in the Web3 space, mainly Solana.\nWhy?\nWeb3 is designed in the way that anyone can work remotely because everything is online. Building the community is done online, building Dapps is done online, marketing is also done online, therefore you can easily work remotely on Web3\nAlso, I believe that Web3 will be the next paradigm shift in our lives, just like how the internet had shifted our lives in the early years, and how mobile phones made another big change in our lives. Web3, crypto, NFTs, DeFi will also be the next shift. Therefore, lots of potential and I will definitely benefit from it for being early in the space.\nI may be wrong, but it doesn’t matter.\nWhat matters is that I acquire the right skills, skills that allow me to work remotely.\nI have been on the journey on Cloud Technology since last year and landed myself in a Cloud Engineer position which is great. Thankfully, I am still in the learning phase and I am not tasked with lots of work yet.\nI will be documenting my learning, currently preparing for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam and will be looking into DevOps certification next.\nAlso, I will be documenting and building some personal projects to showcase my knowledge. While doing all that, I will be actively looking out for DevOps opportunities in the Web3 space.\nSo if you are a project owner in Solana and looking for a DevOps guy, feel free to reach out to me.\nI would also like to learn web development to have a better chance of my landing a foot in the Web3 space.\nI will be also looking out for an intern position where I can work for free and just contribute and learn as I go along with the projects.\nI believe that by learning more and showcasing my learnings + projects, on top of actively looking for opportunities, I will have a higher chance in landing myself a remote work in Web3\nSuper excited on how things will change by the end of year (hopefully!🤞🏻)\nWish me luck\nNick\n","wordCount":"966","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://nickng.life/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2022-05-06T09:23:12+08:00","dateModified":"2022-05-06T09:23:12+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nick"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nickng.life/posts/im-going-full-remote/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nick Ng","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nickng.life/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nickng.life/ accesskey=h title="Nick Ng (Alt + H)">Nick Ng</a>
