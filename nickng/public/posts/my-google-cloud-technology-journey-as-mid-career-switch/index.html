I have come a long way since then and managed to land myself a Cloud Engineer role in a bank.\nSo today, I’ll be sharing with you my journey - how and why I joined the program, what is the program all about and whether you should take up the program as well.\nWhy I join the program When covid hit in 2020, things were not going so well in my previous job so I knew that I had to start thinking about my plans in terms of my career and after narrowing down, I knew that the only industry that I could take a step into would be the IT industry.\nReason being, there is a huge demand of manpower in the industry and IT is something that I could learn on my own especially with so many free resources online these days.\nHowever, the IT industry itself is really broad and there are many areas within IT such as Cybersecurity, Web Design, Developer, Cloud Computing, Networking, Tech Support and so on.\nAt that point in time, I didn’t know which areas would interest me, so I thought that I should take the first step in, whichever area it could be, and then explore all the other areas from there onwards.\nI had a few criteria while looking for courses and programs. As I was out of job at that time, I needed some sort of income to sustain my living expenses, I also needed some sort of credentials after completing so that I have a higher chance to look for jobs and the course had to accept people with no prior background because clearly, I do not have any.\nSo one day I chanced upon the Google’s Skills Ignition Cloud Technology program while doing my research and it fits well with my criteria, but I have no idea what cloud computing is all about at that time.\nI remembered a friend who majors in Computer Science shared with us over our usual friends’ gathering that, if we ever want to take a step into the IT industry, we should consider taking the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, which is a cloud-related certification.\nAnother friend of mine had also switched his career from the healthcare to IT industry and was doing cloud-related work at that point in time.\nSo after doing some research and consulting both of my friends, I believed that this program was a very good opportunity for me.\nWhat is Skills Ignition SG Cloud Technology Program? So what is this program all about?\nSkill Ignition SG is a program launched by Google together with the Singapore Government to build in-demand skills for Singaporeans.\nIt was first launched in July 2020 and the program offers training in Digital Marketing, Cloud Technology, Data Engineering with Machine Learning Fundamentals. The program consists of 2 pathways.\nPathway 1 is where you will undergo a 6-month training and you will receive a monthly training allowance of $1,500 throughout the whole training. There is also a training cost of $500 which is payable by SkillsFuture credits.\nPathway 2, on the hand, is a 9-month program where you will be trained in the first 3 months before going through the on-job training for the next 6 months. You will not receive a monthly training allowance, but you will be paid a monthly salary and there is no training cost for this pathway.\nThere is a new Pathway 3 and it is different from Pathway 1 \u0026 2 where it is a flexible, self-paced online training through Coursera. The training that they provide is different as well, there are 4 tracks, Data Analytics, IT Support, UX Design and Project Management. There is a bonus track, IT Automation, which is only available to learners who have completed IT Support certification.\nWhile Pathway 1 is designed for mid-career workers and Pathway 2 is designed for entry-level workers, Pathway 3 is designed for anyone. Yes, you heard it, anyone can take pathway 3 and learn at your own pace. The only recommendation by Google is that learners should have at least a secondary school education for Pathway 3.\nThe program is tailored for people with no prior experience or degree and you will receive a certification after completion. However, there is certain pre-requisite for Digital Marketing, and Data Engineering with Machine Learning Fundamentals track in Pathway 1 \u0026 2. Do check out their FAQ section.\nYou can now see how this program fits well with my criteria. There will be a monthly allowance paid, and there will be a certification after completion.\nPathway 1 Program Structure The program is divided into 2 parts\n online live class and hands-on courses \u0026 labs on Coursera  The online live class is a daily 3-hour session on weekdays, and the courses on Coursera are required to be completed monthly. Every month, the training provider, Agilitics will assign learners the set of courses on Coursera to be completed.\nIf you are someone like me who learn better through hands-on training, there are plenty of hands-on labs for you to work on as well.\nIn order to receive your monthly training allowance, you will need to maintain a 75% attendance for the online class and submit all the course certifications on Coursera which are to be completed for that month.\nIn the last month of the course, there will be a final group project and after the course, you can take the Google Professional Cloud Architect Certification which they have been preparing you for.\nIt is optional to complete the certification, however, I would strongly recommend everyone to take the certification as your exam fees are waived by Agilitics on your first attempt and, Google PCA Certification is one of the highest paying IT certifications.\nWhat will you learn? Throughout the entire program, you will learn various Google cloud services such as,\nCompute\n Google Compute Engine Google Kubernetes Engine App Engine  Storage\n Google Cloud Storage  Databases\n Cloud SQL Cloud Firestore Cloud Spanner Cloud Bigtable Bigquery  Serverless\n App Engine Cloud Run Cloud Functions  Others\n IAM Roles and Permissions Monitoring \u0026 Billings CI/CD Pipelines Terraform Cloud Pub/Sub  and many more. You will learn how each of these services works, when should you use them and all the best practices.\nOverall, I would say that you will learn a good amount of depth in each of the services. You will have sufficient knowledge of what cloud computing is all about by the end of the course, and theses knowledge will allow you to learn other cloud platforms quickly such as AWS and Azure as the concepts are generally the same in all the different Cloud providers.\nAlso, you will learn how to design and architect infrastructures in your final project like how you would in the real world.\nEmployability So the question now is, will you land a job after completing this program?\nIt depends.\nI can’t say that you will find a job for sure, but I would say that you will have a higher chance to land yourself an IT job now, especially with the certification and the knowledge that you have learned\nI have applied for 47 cloud-related jobs after I completed my certification, out of which, 6 companies rejected my application and manage to be interviewed by 1 company which I am working in right now.\nEven though you have the knowledge and certification after completing the program, one of the challenges you will face is the lack of work experience.\n3 ways to increase your employability Build projects\nSo one way to compensate for your lack of working experience is to work on some projects that are built on cloud platforms which you have learnt. This way, you can have a portfolio to showcase to your employers.\nOne simple project that you can work on is building your cloud resume or you can work on other cloud projects here\nLearn in public\nAnother way is to learn in public, document and showcase what you have learned throughout the whole program.\nThis will help you\n learn better when you simply create/teach others, have a higher chance to be employed since your employers would be able to see what you have learned during your course.  Learn other Cloud platforms\nYou can also continue learning other cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure since now you have a fundamental knowledge of cloud computing and the concepts are generally the same.\nYou can even go a step further and deploy your projects on these 3 cloud providers which will showcase that you can build something in all 3 cloud platforms.\nOutplacement programme Even though this program doesn’t guarantee you a job position after you graduate, Skills Ignition SG provides candidates with the opportunity to connect with employers in high-growth fields through their Outplacement Programme, where graduates get access to their job boards, career fairs, and career workshop sessions.\nYou will also receive job opportunities frequently from Agilitics, the training provider, and this will give you access to many opportunities that connect you to employers who are actively hiring.\nConclusion Overall I find that the program was a great opportunity for people like me who are looking for a career switch. The topics that were taught were well rounded and in great depth which is sufficient to get started in the Cloud Computing field.\nThough, I feel that the course duration could be condensed down further into a shorter time frame rather than 6-month, the course pace was comfortable and manageable.\nSo is this program for you? If you are considering a career switch, especially into the IT field, this is one of a great place to start as you do not need to have any prior knowledge to learn. Plus, you will also be paid an allowance while you are learning.\nThat being said, this is not the only option you have for a career switch, if you feel that you would like to learn Azure Cloud platforms instead, there is an Azure Cloud Support and DevOps program as well.\nOr if you feel that at the end of the day, Cloud Computing is not your thing, you can check other mid career switch courses out there, there are many other programs such as the Full Stack Developer program too.\nIn my cohort, there was a full time housewife who has been out of the working world for 23 years and if she can complete the program and the certification, I believe anyone can do it too.\nAll you need is a curious mind and the willingness to learn.\nHappy learning!\n Resources These are some resources that I feel it will be useful\n The cloud girl, where she creates visual sketchnotes about GCP Examtopics - Free practice questions for Google Professional Cloud Architect exam  ","wordCount":"1856","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://nickng.life/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2022-03-30T21:12:49+08:00","dateModified":"2022-03-30T21:12:49+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nick"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nickng.life/posts/my-google-cloud-technology-journey-as-mid-career-switch/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"NICK NG","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nickng.life/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nickng.life/ accesskey=h title="Nick Ng (Alt + H)">Nick Ng</a>

You will have sufficient knowledge of what cloud computing is all about by the end of the course, and theses knowledge will allow you to learn other cloud platforms quickly such as AWS and Azure as the concepts are generally the same in all the different Cloud providers.</p><p>Also, you will learn how to design and architect infrastructures in your final project like how you would in the real world.</p><h2 id=employability>Employability<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#employability>#</a></h2><p>So the question now is, will you land a job after completing this program?</p><p>It depends.</p><p>I can’t say that you will find a job for sure, but I would say that you will have a higher chance to land yourself an IT job now, especially with the certification and the knowledge that you have learned</p><p>I have applied for 47 cloud-related jobs after I completed my certification, out of which, 6 companies rejected my application and manage to be interviewed by 1 company which I am working in right now.</p><p>Even though you have the knowledge and certification after completing the program, one of the challenges you will face is the lack of work experience.</p><h3 id=3-ways-to-increase-your-employability>3 ways to increase your employability<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-ways-to-increase-your-employability>#</a></h3><p><strong>Build projects</strong></p><p>So one way to compensate for your lack of working experience is to work on some projects that are built on cloud platforms which you have learnt. This way, you can have a portfolio to showcase to your employers.</p><p>One simple project that you can work on is building your <a href=https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/faq/>cloud resume</a> or you can work on other cloud projects <a href=https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas#the-cloud-project-ideas>here</a></p><p><strong>Learn in public</strong></p><p>Another way is to <a href=https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/>learn in public</a>, document and showcase what you have learned throughout the whole program.</p><p>This will help you</p><ol><li>learn better when you simply create/teach others,</li><li>have a higher chance to be employed since your employers would be able to see what you have learned during your course.</li></ol><p><strong>Learn other Cloud platforms</strong></p><p>You can also continue learning other cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure since now you have a fundamental knowledge of cloud computing and the concepts are generally the same.</p><p>You can even go a step further and deploy your projects on these 3 cloud providers which will showcase that you can build something in all 3 cloud platforms.</p><h3 id=outplacement-programme>Outplacement programme<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#outplacement-programme>#</a></h3><p>Even though this program doesn’t guarantee you a job position after you graduate, Skills Ignition SG provides candidates with the opportunity to connect with employers in high-growth fields through their Outplacement Programme, where graduates get access to their job boards, career fairs, and career workshop sessions.</p><p>You will also receive job opportunities frequently from Agilitics, the training provider, and this will give you access to many opportunities that connect you to employers who are actively hiring.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>Overall I find that the program was a great opportunity for people like me who are looking for a career switch. The topics that were taught were well rounded and in great depth which is sufficient to get started in the Cloud Computing field.</p><p>Though, I feel that the course duration could be condensed down further into a shorter time frame rather than 6-month, the course pace was comfortable and manageable.</p><h3 id=so-is-this-program-for-you>So is this program for you?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#so-is-this-program-for-you>#</a></h3><p>If you are considering a career switch, especially into the IT field, this is one of a great place to start as you do not need to have any prior knowledge to learn. Plus, you will also be paid an allowance while you are learning.</p><p>That being said, this is not the only option you have for a career switch, if you feel that you would like to learn Azure Cloud platforms instead, there is an <a href=https://singapore.generation.org/programs/cloud-support-and-devops/>Azure Cloud Support and DevOps</a> program as well.</p><p>Or if you feel that at the end of the day, Cloud Computing is not your thing, you can check other <a href=https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/career-resources/career-resources/education-career-personal-development/sgunited-mid-career-pathways-programme.html>mid career switch courses</a> out there, there are many other programs such as the <a href=https://singapore.generation.org/programs/junior-full-stack-developer/>Full Stack Developer</a> program too.</p><p>In my cohort, there was a full time housewife who has been out of the working world for 23 years and if she can complete the program and the certification, I believe anyone can do it too.</p><p>All you need is a curious mind and the willingness to learn.</p><p>Happy learning!</p><hr><h2 id=resources>Resources<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#resources>#</a></h2><p>These are some resources
