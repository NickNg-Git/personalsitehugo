      <description>Going full-time remote working has always been on my mind, but this year, I am planning to make it become a reality
It is one of my goals that I will be working on, and by end of this year, I aim to be working on projects remotely.
Why remote working? The possibilities are endless. Yes, I really mean endless.
  I get to work anywhere I want to. I can live in a city with a lower cost of living which will help me on my journey of financial independence</description>
