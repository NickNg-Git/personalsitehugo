      <description>Hi! üëãüèª This is Nick and welcome to my site
I am so excited that I have finally gotten my site up and running. I have always wanted to start my own personal website to help me
  Clarify my thoughts
  Have an online presence
  Create more than I consume
  Yet, I have been putting it aside for about a year now because I find it hard to create just the website alone, and to start writing as I am never someone who is good in writing to begin with.</description>
