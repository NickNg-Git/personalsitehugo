Last week, I wrote about [why I want to be working remotely](https://www.nickng.life/posts/im-going-full-remote/) and today I'll be writing about the steps that I will be taking to achieve that. 



## 1. Research on the high demand roles on Solana
For everything that we do, we have to always do our research.

So the first step is to find out what are the high demand positions there is in the Solana space.

Some ideas that I would be searching from:
- look out for job hiring tweets,
- web3 solana job page
- discord channels, project hiring boards.



## 2. Find out the skills required for that position

After gathering all the information, I will start learning the essential skill set required for the highest demand position. 

There will be tons of skills needed to be competent in a role, however, what I aim for is to fast track and secure a role ASAP. 
That means that I will need to learn the essential skills that can get me kick start quickly and the rest of it I will be learning while I am working with the team.

In order to do that, I will need to find out what are the critical and essential skills needed so that I can quickly get the role. 

Ways I plan to find out the critical skills needed:
- talk to project hirers and understand the skills they require for that position
- talk to people who are already working on projects and get some insights of the skills that they use day to day. 

Although I have mentioned previously that I am Cloud trained (AWS and GCP), I am still open to learn other skills if required. But I would first understand whether there are any opportunities available for Cloud related positions in the Solana space.



## 3. Start learning, building and documenting the process 

At this point all I need to do is to start learning the skills required and document my process (Learn in Public) 

I'll also be focusing on building projects, mini projects to hone my skills. After all, skills and knowledge are useless until they are applied. 

I will be documenting my process mainly on this blog and [twitter](https://twitter.com/0x_starshipweb). I will be tagging my posts with #RoadToRemote in my site so if you're interested, do follow along :)



## 4. Find ways to reach out to hirers
At this stage, I would probably have some portfolio to show to the world and this is where I'll start looking for opportunities to provide values to projects. 

I might help to improve their system on my own and share the feedback with the project team, this way they will take notice of who am I and what I am doing, and hopefully be part of their team. 
Or, I can directly reach out to projects that are hiring as I'll have a better chance now to get noticed at this point.



## Wish me luck
That's all folks, this was a quick pen down of my thoughts, if you have any feedback on what's the best way I should do this or have any resources for me, [do connect with me](https://twitter.com/0x_starshipweb). I'll be happy to hear your thoughts!

Wish me luck!

Nick
