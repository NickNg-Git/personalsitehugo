Hi! üëãüèª This is Nick and welcome to my site

I am so excited that I have finally gotten my site up and running. I have always wanted to start my own personal website to help me


1. Clarify my thoughts

2. Have an online presence

3. Create more than I consume


Yet, I have been putting it aside for about a year now because I find it hard to create just the website alone, and to  start writing as I am never someone who is good in writing to begin with. 

But, I guess nobody is ever good at anything for the first time, and I believe that the only way to get good at something is to face it, take action and work on it. So here I am, taking my first step.

Some topics that I will be focusing on are productivity, self-improvement, tech and anything that interests me.


Also, I hope that one day I will be able to inspire my readers one way or another through my humble site.üòä
